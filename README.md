# About this little project
One page site with CSS3, HTML5, and JavaScript. This site uses Bootstrap for the main framework, using the Starter template. It uses CSS3 transform for the animations, the HTML5 audio element, and Javascript for the mouseover and mouseout. I also found answers on StackOverflow extremely helpful.


- Color Scheme - The color scheme was created at Coolers.co.
- Background - The background pattern is called 'One in a Million' at Subtle Patterns.
- Favicon - The favicon was downloaded from Flaticon.
- Fonts - The h1 and h2 fonts are 'Lobster' and 'Passion One', respectively.
- Custom Navbar - The Bootstrap navbar was colorized with TWBSColor.
- Sounds - Some I found on sound effects websites. Some I converted from YouTube to mp3.

The final product - http://alliwalk.github.io/animal-sounds/
